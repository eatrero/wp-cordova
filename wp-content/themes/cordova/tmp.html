      <blockquote>Nathan has traveled across the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean photographing weddings and families with confidence, trust, and a creative eye since 2007.  Nathan travels a lot for work, and because of that, he’s often on the road.  When Nathan is at home, he spends his time in the San Francisco Bay Area.

        Nathan is a born traveler. As soon as his training wheels were off he was pushing the limits and boundaries of his own small world. Now, instead of cul-de-sacs and city blocks, the boundaries he pushes are cultures and continents. Nate comes with a big smile, infectious laugh, and a warm heart. He’s like that quirky kid everyone knows, unafraid of looking silly to make a perfect photo and to genuinely connect with people of all ages to do so.
